# April Challenges
This is repository shall contain coding challenges I am going to work on this month. Most of these challenges will come from the leetcode 30 day challenges

## 1. Single Number
Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
- Example 1
```Input: [2,2,1]```
```Output: 1```

- Example 2
```Input: [4,1,2,1,2]```
```Output: 4```
